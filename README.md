Just walked out of Screamboat. Jesus. The sound of popcorn crunching still in my ears, like a really loud clock. SO loud, you’d think it could sync a heart to its crackle. My back aches like I've been sitting on a boat...no...a rollercoaster? Anyway. Still spinning bits of dialogue and nonsensical squiggle swords in my head. 

Crazy flick! Outrageous, like a mix between a...I dunno, a Ferris wheel and a broken radio. The villain had this waxy face, sorta like if you left a wax museum dummy in the sun too long. And the hero, they threw punches like they were trying to swat away invisible flies. In the middle, there’s a guy who just kept screaming—screaming on a boat, hence Screamboat? Sure, why not.

> At some point, I started thinking about last Thursday’s sandwich. Seemed relevant at the time – maybe it was the mustard - that scene where they spill something yellowish and everyone slips around like cartoon characters on banana peels. Felt like a mustard moment, y’know?

So, yeah, you'd wanna download the movie to relive that splashing chaos. Like dunking your head in a barrel of bizarre. It’s a vibe.

Oh, and remember where someone asked if I could watch the movie - yeh yeh, definitely a sit-in experience more than a background noise one. Not your usual popcorn flick (though ironically, that's what I'm covered in right now).

Some scenes cut so fast, I thought maybe they were missing – like my phone glitching when I’m streaming in a tunnel. A humming blur! Think of a goose wearing a detective hat, then dive to the lunacy pit from there.

And then someone, or everyone? Laughs, but it’s not that funny – like canned laughter that lost its way and ended up in the wrong sitcom. My hands are sticky from...something, I hope it’s just soda.

numpy.array([ “What is reality, exactly?” ]) # Seriously, what was that though?
